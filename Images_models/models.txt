## Models for 2D Clothes Swapping Pipeline

1. **MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation**  
   - Purpose: Segment user’s body and shirt/clothes area from photo.  
   - Mobile-friendly, real-time segmentation.

2. **DeepLabV3 (MobileNet backbone)**  
   - Purpose: Alternative for higher-accuracy semantic segmentation.

3. **U^2-Net Light**  
   - Purpose: Remove background from shirt photo for clean garment extraction.

4. **MODNet (Mobile optimized)**  
   - Purpose: Another option for person/background segmentation and background removal.

5. **MoveNet Lightning**  
   - Purpose: Fast pose estimation to find body keypoints for aligning clothes.

6. **Apple Vision Pose Estimation** (iOS specific)  
   - Purpose: Native high-performance pose detection on iOS.

7. **Thin-plate spline / Affine warp (algorithmic)**  
   - Purpose: Image warping technique for fitting shirt onto user body (not ML model but essential).

8. **Alpha blending (algorithmic)**  
   - Purpose: Seamless blending of warped shirt image onto user photo.

9. **Pix2Pix Mobile (optional GAN)**  
   - Purpose: Refine blending, add realism to merged shirt and user image.

10. **Mobile-optimized VITON-like GAN (optional)**  
    - Purpose: Advanced clothes transfer and texture detail enhancement.


# Stepwise Instructions for Mobile 2D Clothes Swapping

## 1. Capture & Preprocess User Image
- Allow user to upload or take a photo in the app.
- Resize/crop the image to a fixed resolution for model input balance between quality and speed.

## 2. Body Segmentation & Garment Extraction
- Run a lightweight segmentation model (e.g., MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation) on the user photo to identify the body and clothing areas.
- Separately, run U²-Net Light or MODNet to remove the background and extract the garment from the clothes photo.

## 3. Pose Estimation
- Use MoveNet Lightning (cross-platform) or Apple Vision Pose Estimation (iOS only) to detect body keypoints in the user photo.

## 4. Garment Warping and Alignment
- Use detected keypoints to calculate transformation matrices.
- Apply thin-plate spline or affine warp to deform the garment image to fit the user's pose/shape.
- Implement this step using native optimized code to achieve performance.

## 5. Naked Body Reconstruction (for sleeve removal)
- Employ a lightweight body inpainting model (e.g., PEIPNet) to reconstruct occluded body parts (like arms under sleeves).
- This model fills in the skin texture where sleeves were covering.

## 6. Image Blending
- Integrate the warped garment onto the user image using alpha blending for seamless edges.
- Use GPU-accelerated routines for this blending.

## 7. Optional Refinement with GAN
- Optionally run a lightweight GAN-based model (like MobileStyleGAN) to enhance realism.
- Consider running this in the background asynchronously to avoid blocking UI.

## 8. Display Result and User Interaction
- Show the final swapped image in the React Native app UI.
- Allow user adjustments like garment positioning or swapping garments.

## 9. Optimization & Deployment
- Quantize and prune all models for mobile efficiency.
- Leverage mobile accelerator APIs (TensorFlow Lite, CoreML).
- Profile and optimize CPU/GPU usage.
